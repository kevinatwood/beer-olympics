  ## Description
  The point of this project was to create a full-stack application where you can create an account and create or join a team for a beer olympics tournament. This application uses JavaScript, CSS, and Handlebars. This solves the problem of having to force one person to take care of all of the matchmaking and keeping track of who advances and who doesn't. It isn't an easy job for one person to take on alone, so this solves that headache. There are many updates that will be added over time. 
  
  
  ## Installation
  The installation process consists of installing all the packages with the command "npm install".
  
  
  ## Usage
  The steps for usage consists of going to the deployed webpage and logging in or signing up.
